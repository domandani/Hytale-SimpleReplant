# SimpleReplant

**SimpleReplant** is a Hytale mod that automatically replants crops when you harvest them. It makes farming faster by placing a new seed down for you immediately.

## ✨ Features
* **Automatic Replanting:** When you harvest a fully grown crop, a new seed is automatically placed from your inventory.
* **Inventory Aware:** The mod checks your inventory for the correct seed type before attempting to replant.
* **Crouch to Bypass:** Need to clear a field? Simply **crouch (sneak)** while harvesting to disable the auto-replant feature temporarily.
* **Smart Harvesting:** Only triggers on fully grown plants to prevent accidental seed loss on immature crops.

## Supported Crops

## 🛠️ Usage
* **Normal Harvest:** Walk up to a fully grown crop (like Wheat or Carrots) and break it. If you have the corresponding seeds in your inventory, they will be planted immediately.
* **Manual Clear:** Hold your **Sneak** key while breaking a crop. The mod will ignore the harvest, allowing you to clear the soil or change crop types.
